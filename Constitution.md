****

# PART 1—PRELIMINARY 

### 1. Name 

1. The name of the incorporated association is "_Fusion Political Party_". In this document the incorporated association is also referred to as the “Association”. 

2. The Association has previously been known as “Climate Emergency Action Alliance: Vote Planet”.

> **Note:** Under section 23 of the Act, the name of the Association and its registration number must appear on all its business documents. 


### 2. Purposes 

1. The purposes of the Association are to— 

   1. enable its membership to register as a formal political party at federal, state, territory, and local government levels. 

   2. advance any shared policy or platform agreed to by the membership.

   3. facilitate the advancement of policy supported by non-conflicting branch values with branch backing..

   4. achieve the above goals through 

      1. public education and political and non-political campaigning, including running candidates for election at all levels of government, and 

      2. providing an organisational vehicle for groups of like minded members to organise and subsequently advocate for and advance focus areas of special interest, insofar as this does not conflict with the value framework.

2. To further these purposes, the Association must develop capacity in the following areas— 

   1. establishment of its organisational elements; 

   2. ongoing organisational management; 

   3. managing formal registration as a political party federally and in other jurisdictions of Australia as appropriate;

   4. election campaigning;

   5. community mobilisation;

   6. issue based campaigning; and 

   7. providing the organisational vehicle that can coordinate and facilitate the above on behalf of the Association's Branches.


### 3. Values

1. The Association will utilise a framework for aligning the values and principles of its constituent branches into a synergistic and compatible structure which will be considered the “Fusion Value Framework”.

2. Branches may operate with their own value frameworks insofar as they:

   1. materially align with the framework of the Association,

   2. are not shown to be in material conflict with the framework of the Association.

3. Changing the value framework should not be undertaken lightly. Undertaking a review of the value framework must be the result of a decision of the committee identifying a capacity in which the framework is insufficient for, or in conflict with, the needs and direction of the Association.

4. The value framework will only be reviewed for potential change according to a structured process that is recognised as appropriate for the task.

> **Note:** The original framework was formulated using the GFMAM methodology for developing an asset management framework with the philosophy of “Policy as an Asset”. 

5. Changes to the value framework must be ratified by the Committee.

6. The committees of the Association’s branches may challenge a change so long as:

   1. the branch attends to reviewing it within a period of not greater than 3 months,

   2. the branch is capable of fulfilling a quorum for the decision according to their internal processes within the period in question.

7. The inability of a branch to attend to the matter within the required timeframe may not block the revision of the value framework, but the association is responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that they do not create a material conflict with a framework of the branch if it maintains one. 

8. Changes to the value framework will be communicated to the members not later than the next applicable general meeting.

9. It should be possible to communicate the alignment of the policy of the Association to the value framework.

### 19. Dispute Resolution Committee

1. The Committee shall facilitate a Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) to attend to any disciplinary matters arising (as per rule [19]), complaints or concerns of a potential breach of the Code of Conduct to determine what action, if any, should be taken or recommended to the Committee. 

2. The DRC shall comprise five members that:

   1. are democratically elected by the membership; and

   2. hold no other office on the Committee, or named position appointed by the Committee, or equivalent office within a branch of the Association, except for other elected positions solely existing for the purpose of providing dispute resolution capacity;

2. For a dispute raised between people within the same branch, the complainant may choose to have it investigated by their branch specific DRC or equivalent process. Regardless of outcome however, the investigation may still be taken to the DRC.

3. For the purpose of resolving less serious complaints, refer to the process outlined in Part 3 Division 3-Grievance Procedure, with the stipulation that the mediator must either be a member of the DRC or hold an equivalent position in a branch.

4. In the case of a serious complaint involving a potential breach of Standards the Executive will determine whether the issue is investigated by the DRC or an investigating officer who will attempt to resolve the complaint between the parties.

   1. The investigating officer should be a member of the DRC, but must at least be an equivalent position in a branch.

5. In the case of a serious complaint involving an accusation of misconduct or a breach of the Constitution, the DRC will investigate the substance of the complaint.

6. Upon investigation the DRC may proceed to order disciplinary action on appropriate grounds.

7. In matters being investigated the DRC is responsible for;

   1. determining if a complaint is to be deemed genuine or vexatious; and

   2. protecting the privacy of both the complainant and the complainee.

# PART 8—SPECIAL RULES 

## Division 1—Voting method for Association elections 

### 80. Elections that are covered 

1. These procedures must be applied to— 

   1. the election of candidates for parliamentary elections held by the Association; and 

2. Rules\* made under these Rules to govern other elections may require that ballots must— 

   1. be conducted in conformity with this Division; and 

   2. be secret. 

(\* e.g. binding policies and procedures in the Operations Manual and operating rules for units of the Association.) 


### 81. Voting system 

1. The voting method that must be used is optional preferential modified to allow the selection of the option: “Seek further candidates”. 


### 82. Modes – physical, postal, online 

1. Ballots governed by this Division may be conducted in a physical meeting, by post or using a secure online facility. 


### 83. Returning officers 

1. The unit of the Association responsible for the conduct of a ballot governed by this Division must appoint a returning officer to manage the ballot process. 

2. Where the conduct of a ballot involves more than one physical location, the returning officer must appoint an assistant returning officer for each physical location. 

3. Returning officers, including assistants, must not be candidates in the ballot. 


### 84. Scrutineers 

1. A candidate may appoint one scrutineer for each location where tallying of votes for the candidate is being conducted. 


### 85. Election integrity 

1. Returning officers must prepare ballot papers in such a way that they are identifiably official and so that they cannot be forged. 

2. Ballot papers, electronic voting records and any tally data must be handled securely so that the validity of the ballot is assured. 

3. All Members have a duty to ensure that ballots are conducted in accordance with these Rules and without mistakes or corruption. 


### 86. Secret ballots 

1. Secret ballots must be held for— 

   1. the election of office bearer members of the Committee; 

   2. the election of candidates for parliamentary elections. 


### 87. Ballot papers 

1. Subject to sub-rule (2), ballot forms must have the candidates' names listed and include a voting option of “Seek further candidates”. 

2. If candidates for a ballot are to be finalised at the meeting where the ballot is to take place, the returning officer in charge may decide to use blank ballot papers or ballots with no candidates names on them and if this is the case the returning officer must instruct voters to write the names of the candidates on the ballot paper and, if not already on the ballot papers, the option of “Seek further candidates”. 


### 88. Candidates rights 

1. Candidates must be given an equal opportunity to provide voters with a short statement in support of their candidacy prior to the ballot and the returning officer in charge may determine whether the statement is to be in writing or in spoken form or both. 


### 89. Voting 

1. Returning officers must inform voters of the voting procedure and their rights and obligations under this Division. 

2. A voter must be provided with a ballot paper for their personal use plus one ballot paper for each proxy that they hold (up to the maximum permitted number). 

3. Voters must number candidates in order of declining preference, beginning with 1 and moving to the next larger whole number for each subsequent preference until there are no further candidates or the voter no longer wishes to express a preference at which point they may choose the “Seek further candidates” option. 


### 90. Tallying of votes 

1. Votes will be deemed to be valid, despite technical errors in recording the vote, provided the intention of the voter is clear and unambiguous and can be interpreted by a reasonable person as following the intent of the voting procedure. 

> **Note** If a number is missed in a voting sequence on a ballot paper, eg. 1, 2, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5 the order of candidate preference is clear and so the ballot paper would not be invalid. If the numbers were 1, 2, 2, 3 this vote would not be valid as a sequential preference for two candidates was not indicated. 

2. Tallying of the vote must follow these steps— 

   1. **Determining a quota**: a quota must be determined using the following formula, with the result rounded up to the next highest whole number— 

> **Rule:** (number of voters/(number of positions to fill +1))+1\
> **Example:** Where there are 100 voters and 7 positions \
> (100/(7+1))+1 = (100/8)+1 = 12.5 + 1 = 13.5 = **14** after rounding up. 

2. **Determining first preference results**: each ballot paper on which the name of a candidate has been **marked** with a 1 (ie. received a first preference) must be counted as one vote for that candidate; 

3. **Determining if a candidate has achieved a quota with first preferences**: if any candidate has **received** at least a quota of votes based solely on their first preference votes then that candidate must be declared elected; 

4. **Full value preferences and reduced value preferences**: If a candidate gets more than a quota of votes, then the value of that excess may need to be passed on to the other candidates in proportion to the next preference of the voters of the elected candidate; and the **candidate** without a quota who has the least number of votes must have their votes passed on at full value to the other unelected candidates in accordance with the next preference of the voters for that candidate; 

5. **Calculating the reduced value of votes distributed from an elected candidate**: The reduced **value** of first preference votes to be distributed from an elected candidate must be calculated using the following formula— 

**Rule:** (total first preference votes - quota)/quota\
**Example** Where the quota is 25 and the total number of first preference votes for an elected candidate is 37: 

(37−25) 25 = (12÷25) = 0.48\
i.e. if a bundle of 100 votes was distributed to a candidate at 0.48 value then the value of the bundle of votes would be 100 x 0.48 = **48.** 

6. **Calculating the reduced value of already reduced value votes to be transferred from an elected candidate**: The reduced value of already reduced value votes to be distributed from an elected **candidate** must be calculated using the following formula— 

> **Rule:** Current value discount x ((Total calculated value of votes held by candidate-quota)/quota)\
> **Example** Where the quota is 25 and the total value of votes for an elected candidate is 37 and the current value discount of reduced value votes is 0.3:\
> 0.3x((37-25)÷25) (0.3)x(12÷25) = 0.3x0.48 = 0.144\
> i.e. if a bundle of 100 votes was distributed to a candidate at 0.144 value then the value of the bundle of votes would be 100 x 0.144 = **14.4.\
> Note:** The above examples may require additional research and advice to effectively manage elections. recording ballots into spreadsheets and developing appropriate coding is one way to calculate election outcomes effectively.

7. **Keeping the reduced value attached to the votes**: As reduced value votes are distributed from an elected candidate to below-quota candidates, the calculated reduced value of those votes **must** be kept attached in either a physical sense or in an accounting sense to each bundle of those votes, so that they are always counted at the correct reduced value; 

8. **Distributing preferences (quota excess)**: Candidates that have achieved a quota (and have therefore been elected) must have the transferable value of all their votes distributed to the other candidates in accordance with the next preference of their voters – and this **distribution** must start with the candidate with the largest quota excess; and the votes must be transferred at the value calculated in sub-rules (e) and (f); this process continues until there are no excess quotas to distribute, and then the distribution process in sub-rule (i) is activated; 

9. **Distributing preferences (under quota)**: When there are candidates with votes below a quota, and not all the positions have been filled and the option “Seek other candidates” has not achieved a quota, then the votes of the below-quota candidate with the lowest value of **votes** must be distributed, at their current value, to the other non-elected candidates; and this process of distributing the votes of the lowest vote candidate must be repeated until another candidate gains a quota (triggering the process under sub-rule (h) or until all positions are filled or the option “Seek other candidates” achieves a quota and ends the tally process; 

10. **Breaking a tie when distributing preferences**: If two or more candidates with the lowest number of below-quota votes, or candidates with the highest number of above- quota votes have ****an equal value of votes, then the returning officer must arrange for a person who is not a candidate to undertake a blind draw to select at random one candidate who will have their preferences distributed next. 

11. **A quota for “Seek further candidates” ends the tally:** If the option “Seek further candidates” ****gains a quota, the filling of further positions must cease. 

3) When the tally is completed the outcome must be declared by the returning officer in charge. 


### 91. Seeking further candidates 

1. If the option “Seek further candidates” gains a quota, the relevant unit of the Association 

2. must initiate a process to seek further candidates and to hold a supplementary election to fill the unfilled position(s).

   2. act as the Election Campaign Committee itself. 

> **Note:** If the Committee decides not to create a separate Election Campaign Committee and to take on that role itself, then where the Rules refer to an Election Campaign Committee that means the Committee. 

> **Note:** If only one Branch is contesting any given election the Committee may decide to devolve all functions normally managed by an Election Campaign Committee other than the submitting of relevant candidate registration and electoral returns on behalf of the Association. A Branch may still request the Committee to form or act as an Electoral Campaign Committee to support the election campaign being run by the Branch.


### 102. Electoral Funding

   2. Second, allocation to expenses required to support any successfully elected candidate.

   3. Third, as agreed by the Committee.


### 103. Contested electable positions

1. At times multiple members of the Association will seek to contest electable positions. In this case,  the following rules will be used decide which candidates will be endorsed and in what position:

2. in the case of multi member seats

   1. by mutual agreement between the candidate nominees

   2. by a ballot held by all members of the Association entitled to vote in accordance with sub-rule (2). 

3. in the case of single member seats

   1. by a ballot held by all members of the Association entitled to vote in accordance with sub-rule (2).

   2. by postal ballot; or  

   3. secure online voting system. 


### 104. Elected representatives
